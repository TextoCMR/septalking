SEPTAlking
=========

SEPTAlking is a telephone / IM application that lets you find departure times for SEPTA Regional Rail trains.

This project was developed as part of the Apps for SEPTA civic hackathon.

How it works
===========

SEPTAlking uses the W3C standard for speech recognition - SRGS grammars - and the Tropo platform to provide both a phone and IM interface to the SEPTA ["Next to Arrive" API](http://www3.septa.org/hackathon/).

This project is 100% open source.  Please fork, experiment and improve.

An official launch of SEPTAlking in Philadelphia is planned for Fall 2011.
